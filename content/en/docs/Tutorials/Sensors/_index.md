## General

Sensors are used to retrieve information about the robot's surrounding environment. In general, there are a few things to know regarding usage of sensors in Erebus:

1. Each type of sensor has a respective class that must be imported/included in the controller.
2. Sensors must be enabled before they are used (usually at the beginning of the controller program).
2. Sensor values are only updated after each simulation timestep.

Please see the individual pages for specific details and samples for each sensor.
