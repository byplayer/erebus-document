## Introducing Your Robot
> *picture of Robot in simulation environment with Motors and Sensors labelled*

> *Example copied from tutorial 2/Navigate the maze:*

In this challenge, the robot is fixed and as Epuc (this is actually a real world robot!) Your robot has a number of components:
* Left and Right wheels. Can be controlled independently to set the speed
* Distance Sensors. A number of distance sensors around the robot to detect walls/objects
* Camera. Two RGB cameras on the front of the robot to provide visual information

## Motors
> *explination of the location and abilities of the motors*

## Sensors
Here is a list of all the sensors available on the robot with a short description of their function.

### Distance sensor
> *add describtion similar to the light sensor*

### Light sensor
The light sensors are placed on the bottom side along the perimeter of the robot. They allow the robot to gather information about the color of the floor below it.
There are X light sensors in total and they are spaced evenly along the robot's perimeter.
> *needs to adapted if robot customisation is implemented*

### Location sensor
> *add describtion similar to the light sensor*

### RGB camera
> *add describtion similar to the light sensor*

### LIDAR sensor
> *add describtion similar to the light sensor*
