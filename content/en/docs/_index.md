## Erebus Rescue Simulator
Erebus is a robot simulation competition environment in which you must develop a controller for a robot to explore a maze, use sensing methods to find as many 'victims', and map the environment whilst avoid obstacles and traps. 

It is built on [Webots](https://cyberbotics.com/), a robotic simulation platform designed for a professional use and has been widely used in industry, education and research. Cyberbotics maintains Webots as its main product continuously since 1998. Here is a link to [Webots official User Guide](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/index). On this site we present documentation as well as tutorials and guides for using the Erebus simulator.
